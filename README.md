# Modeling and Predictive Analysis of the Relationship Between Seagrass Beds and Marine Biodiversity Based on Graph Neural Network

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and predicting the dynamic relationship between seagrass beds and marine biodiversity using a graph neural network (GNN) approach. The ecological role of seagrass as a foundation species makes it crucial for maintaining marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Motivation

Seagrass beds provide critical habitat for marine organisms, yet their ecological complexity and dynamic interactions with biodiversity are not fully understood. Traditional models often fail to capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity present in marine ecosystems. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and ecological insight.

## Methodology

- **Data Sources**: Utilized multi-source ecological data including remote sensing imagery, field observations, and marine biodiversity indices.
- **Graph Construction**: Constructed spatial-temporal ecological networks representing species interactions and environmental factors.
- **Model Architecture**: Implemented a graph neural network (GNN) framework to model interactions and predict biodiversity distribution patterns.
- **Feature Extraction**: Integrated spatial features from remote sensing (e.g., NDVI from EO data) and ecological indicators.
- **Evaluation**: Compared GNN performance against traditional machine learning models such as Random Forests and SVM.

## Key Results

- GNN demonstrated superior accuracy in capturing nonlinear relationships and predicting biodiversity hot spots.
- Spatial heterogeneity and species interactions were effectively encoded in the graph structure.
- The model revealed key ecological drivers influencing biodiversity across seagrass beds.

## Applications

- **Conservation Planning**: Informs marine protected area (MPA) design and seagrass restoration strategies.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Enables real-time prediction and tracking of biodiversity changes.
- **Decision Support**: Provides ecological insights to support policy and sustainable coastal management.

## Future Work

- Incorporation of additional environmental layers such as water quality and climate data.
- Expansion to other coastal ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves).
- Real-time model deployment with satellite monitoring pipelines.
